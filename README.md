# DSDiagrams

This repositor contains a series of Java, Python, and shell scripts that can generate diagrams for use in a Data Structures class.

The diagrams include: array-based list, nodes-based list, stack, queue, trees, and graphs. The graph generation is done by (Graphviz)[https://graphviz.org].
